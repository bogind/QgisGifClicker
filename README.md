### Disclaimer

This might be the most useless plugin I ever built, but it's fun so have fun with it.  
I might add more functionality in the future but I might not.  

If you have a proper use case for this plugin let me know, it might increase the chances of me adding things.

The current GIFs available were creates using assets from [https://kenney.nl/](https://kenney.nl/), I recommend checking them out even if you don't need any game assets.
